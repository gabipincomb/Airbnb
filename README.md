December 2019 Capstone Project

## Project Description

As an advocate for Airbnb, and an avid user of the platform, I decided to focus my project on Airbnb. As a user, I recognized my own personal behavior when searching for bookings; there are three things I typically look at: location, cost, and host rating. I noticed a trend in my behavior -- most of my stays have been with Superhosts. In fact, that is usually something I filter upon when searching for my listings, and I found myself asking "what does it take to become a Superhost?".

## Project Objective

Using the open-sourced data from http://insideairbnb.com/, I decided to do an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Austin Airbnb listings and use machine learning to predict if a listing is hosted by a Superhost.
